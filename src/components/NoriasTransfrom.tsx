        <h2 className="subtitle">Hama Grows</h2>
            <p>
                The Orontes Valley forms a boundary between the deserts of Syria and the mountains to the west, placing Hama at
                the center of the wet/dry farming zone. With its fertile terra rossa soil and the Orontes River, Hama was in a
                prime position for economic growth. The norias ensured a consistent water supply and the irrigation of crops,
                even during the hostile dry season, making them a matter of life and death <em>(NMOD; Bartl 2; UW).</em>
            </p>

        <h2 className="subtitle">Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                With the noria drawing its power directly from the water, it can move vast amounts of water without relying on
                animal or human labor. This surplus water could then be used for fountains and technological developments (
                <em>see Figures 3.3–3.5</em>).
            </p>

        <h2 className="subtitle">Culture</h2>
        <h3 className="subheading">Recreation</h3>
            <p>
                The dams of the noria, forming convenient swimming pools, and the revolving wheel, acting as an elevator, made
                the noria a source of recreation to cool off during the summer.{" "}

                People rode the noria
                </a>
                , using it as a unique diving platform, while the less adventurous waded in the surrounding water, washed
                clothes, or went fishing <em>(see Figs. 1.3, 4.1, and 4.2).</em>

        <h3 className="subheading">Art</h3>
            <p>
                The influence of the water wheels was not only practical but also artistic. While on an expedition to Hama,
                architect Ejnar Leo Fugmann was inspired by the norias and painted around 100 watercolors of Hama and its water
                wheels <em>(see Figs. 4.3 and 4.4) (NMOD)</em>. The norias have also inspired poets, as seen in Considerations
                about the Dolab-nama, where T&uuml;rkan has collected poems inspired by water wheels.

            <h3 className="poem-title">The Ode of the Water Wheel</h3>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
            Today, I questioned a water wheel,
            <br />
            I asked, "Why do you turn upon this stream?"
             <br />
             <br />
            "Why is your chest pierced, your eyes full of tears,
            <br />
            What causes you to lament with such reproach?"
            <br />
             <br />
            "You have no rest, turning day and night,
            <br />
            Pouring blood-stained tears from sorrowful eyes."
                <br />
             <br />
            "Your straight stature has bent like a bow,
            <br />
            Your groaning has become a melody for the rebab."
            <br />
             <br />
            "In the morning, your tears flow endlessly,
            <br />
            You do not find a moment’s sleep at night."
            <br />
            <br />
            "Why do you cry out in anguish and pain,
            <br />
            Is your sorrow beyond measure or account?"
                <br />
             <br />
            "Your grieving chest has been pierced by groans,
            <br />
            Your sighs have turned hearts into burning embers."
                <br />
             <br />
            "What news has fate delivered to you,
            <br />
            That your ledger of grief could not fit into books?"
                <br />
             <br />
            "What cruelty has this tyrannical wheel inflicted on you,
            <br />
            That you’ve fallen into this endless reproach?"
                <br />
             <br />
            "Your smoke has darkened the blue skies above,
            <br />
            And your sighs have turned the earth into dust below."
                <br />
             <br />
            I asked about the water wheel’s endless turning,
            <br />
            And as it turned, the wheel gave me its reply.
            </p>
        </div>
            <p>
            T&uuml;rkan also writes the following passage, highlighting the reputation the norias have established:
            </p>
        <blockquote className="highlight">
            The waterwheel has become an indispensable classic for Turkish poets because it turns slowly, making sounds
            similar to crying. In these poems, the lover identifies himself as a waterwheel. The love and the screams of
            the lover with the feeling of staying apart from their beloved are similar to the groans heard from far away
            Dolab-nama also means the verse in question from the language of the water closet with the question, “Expressing
            the chant of love of Allah.” Moreover, the insufficient definition of the dolab-nama was emphasized. (Alvan
            443)
        </blockquote>

        <h3 className="subheading">Tourism</h3>
            <p>
                Tourism is also driven by the noria. In 2006, Noria al-Muhammadiyya was listed as an engineering landmark{" "}
                <em>(ASME 10)</em>, solidifying its status as a cultural icon of Syria that attracts tourists to admire its
                beauty. Next to some of the norias are cafes where tourists can relax and enjoy a delicious meal (see{" "}

        <h3 className="subheading">Video Games</h3>
            <p>
                The impact of the norias extends even into video games, where their iconic wooden structures captivate creators.
                With their timeless aesthetic, norias are ideal for world-building games such as <em>Anno 1404</em> and{" "}
                <em>Kingdoms and Castles</em>, each featuring norias in their gameplay <em>(see Fig. 4.6) (Anno 1404 Wiki;
                Elreyboro).</em>
