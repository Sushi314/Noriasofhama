      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Norias are ancient water-lifting devices powered by flow of the river, the stand as a monument of early hydraulic engineering and technological development. Norias played a critical role in irrigation and urban water supply in the ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. By examining the historical origins, technological advancements, and cultural significance of norias, we can better understand their pivotal role in shaping ancient societies and influencing subsequent mechanical innovations. 

Hama, Syria is home to 14 of the largest medieval waterwheels that are still functioning today. The largest towering 21 meters (69 feet) over the Orontes river call named Noria al-Muhammadiyya. It supplied water to the al-A’la Mosque, bath house of Hammam al-Dahab also the gardens, houses, and fountains in the area (ASME, 2006).  </p>
