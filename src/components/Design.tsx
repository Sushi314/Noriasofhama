      <p><strong>Mechanism of Operation: </strong>The paddles around the water wheel's perimeter captured the current's power to create the rotational force required to lift water into the towering aqua ducts. Alongside the paddles were wooden boxes that had an opening on the side of the box at the top. On each rotation the boxes were plunged into the river where they were filling water the noria continued to carry the water to the top. After reaching the top of the wheel, the opening on the box's side aligned with the aqueduct, allowing the water to flow out of the side into the collection area of the aqueduct. </p>
